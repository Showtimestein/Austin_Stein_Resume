# Austin Stein's Resume

I started this resume using Figma well over a month ago. The shapes I built are very intricate, each one is composed of several layers, and was a quite difficult to build in Figma. I spent an absurd amount of time building this one document, and tinkering with it is how I built most of my skill using Figma. Looks pretty cool, right?
